# Project Name: Can of Books

**Author**: Isaiah Keller, Jacob Dang
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->This application is called Can of Books, this application uses book data as a resource and is meant to display that in a partner collaboration, we are able to deploy an app with both of us tackling front-end and back-end code.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? --> The first step of collaboration was designating our positions and roles and communicating how our end works. 

## Collaboration

### Team Agreement 

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - 2 to finish
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack and remo
- How often will you take breaks?
    - self choice,
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - reaching out to teammate or TA, spend extra time

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    - Jacob Dang - backend
    - Isaiah Keller - frontend
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    - devide tasks between front and back 
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - Jacob Dang -
    - Isaiah Keller - need to know the server and db side for the upcoming assessment.  Even though I'll mostly be working on front end, I will need to work through the backend code as well
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    - screen share and clear communication, work through and check each other's code

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    - continue to communicate any issues
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    - continue to communicate any issues, if that doesn't work we wwill 
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    - continue to communicate, making sure the variables and routes match up.


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. --> Heroku, Netlify, React

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
2pm - Code template cloned and personal markups are being added
3pm - Files are added and deployment will begin
