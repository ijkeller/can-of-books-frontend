# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.


# Project Name: Can of Books


**Author**: Isaiah Keller, Jacob Dang
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->This application is called Can of Books, this application uses book data as a resource and is meant to display that in a partner collaboration, we are able to deploy an app with both of us tackling front-end and back-end code.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? --> The first step of collaboration was designating our positions and roles and communicating how our end works. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. --> Heroku, Netlify, React

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
2pm - Code template cloned and personal markups are being added
3pm - Files are added and deployment will begin
